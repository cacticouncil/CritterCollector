    CommonName: American Black Duck
    Description: "The American black duck (Anas rubripes) is a large dabbling duck
      in the family Anatidae. It was described by William Brewster in 1902. It is
      the heaviest species in the genus Anas, weighing 720\u20131,640 g (1.59\u20133.62
      lb) on average and measuring 54\u201359 cm (21\u201323 in) in length with a
      88\u201395 cm (35\u201337 in) wingspan. It somewhat resembles the female mallard
      in coloration, but has a darker plumage. The male and female are generally
      similar in appearance, but the male's bill is yellow while the female's is
      dull green with dark marks on the upper mandible. It is native to eastern North
      America. During the breeding season, it is usually found in coastal and freshwater
      wetlands from Saskatchewan to the Atlantic in Canada and the Great Lakes and
      the Adirondacks in the United States. It is a partially migratory species,
      mostly wintering in the east-central United States, especially in coastal areas.\nIt
      interbreeds regularly and extensively with the mallard, to which it is closely
      related. The female lays six to fourteen oval eggs, which have smooth shells
      and come in varied shades of white and buff green. Hatching takes 30 days on
      average. Incubation usually takes 25 to 26 days, with both sexes sharing duties,
      although the male usually defends the territory until the female reaches the
      middle of her incubation period. It takes about six weeks to fledge. Once the
      eggs hatch, the hen leads the brood to rearing areas with abundant invertebrates
      and vegetation.\nThe American black duck is considered to be a species of least
      concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). It has
      long been valued as a game bird. Habitat loss due to drainage, global warming,
      filling of wetlands due to urbanization and rising sea levels are major reasons
      for the declining population of the American black duck. The United States
      Fish and Wildlife Service has been purchasing and managing the habitat of this
      species in many areas to support the migratory stopover, wintering and breeding
      populations. The Atlantic Coast Joint Venture also protects habitat through
      restoration and land acquisition projects, mostly within their wintering and
      breeding areas.\n\n"
